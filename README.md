# Hi, I'm James Lalupu 👋

**Analytics Engineer | People Analytics Specialist | C++ & Python Developer**

I transition Organizational Psychology from intuition-based HR into an exact, quantitative science. My architecture bridges advanced psychometrics (Bifactor Models, Causal Inference) with modern Data Engineering (ETL/ELT, dbt, Cloud) to automate strategic decision-making.

### 🛠 Technical Arsenal
* **Data Engineering & Cloud:** GCP (Cloud Run, Cloud SQL), Terraform (IaC), dbt (Data Build Tool), Docker, PostgreSQL.
* **Analytics Core:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, FastAPI), Advanced SQL, Power BI (DAX, Star Schema), Power Query.
* **High-Performance Logic:** Pure C++17 & pybind11 (Memory management, parallel execution, and Python integration).
* **Statistics & Psychometrics:** Causal Inference, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), Bayesian Analysis.

### 🔭 Production Infrastructure:
* **[Bourbaki Engine Monorepo]:** My core ecosystem. A FAANG-standard architecture integrating a FastAPI Causal Engine, a dbt-powered HR Data Lake (handling PII Hashing & Data Governance), and a C++ Agent-Based Simulator for organizational dynamics.
